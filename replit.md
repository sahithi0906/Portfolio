Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (implied from navigation structure)
- **Design Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with section-based navigation
- **Styling Approach**: CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables) for consistent theming
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Inter) for modern, clean appearance
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.0 for scalable vector icons
- **Layout Strategy**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Backend Architecture
- **Server Technology**: Custom Python HTTP server using built-in `http.server` module
- **Server Pattern**: Simple static file server with custom request handling
- **Security Features**: Basic security headers implementation (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- **Routing**: Minimal routing that serves index.html for root requests

## Key Components

### 1. Static Website Structure
- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the complete portfolio structure
- **styles.css**: Comprehensive CSS file with cybersecurity-themed design system
- **Navigation**: Single-page navigation with sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)

### 2. Design System
- **Color Palette**: Cybersecurity-inspired theme with cyan, blue, and accent colors
- **Typography Scale**: Systematic font sizing using CSS custom properties
- **Spacing System**: Consistent spacing scale for layout harmony
- **Component Architecture**: Modular CSS approach with reusable design tokens

### 3. Python Server
- **Custom Handler**: Extends SimpleHTTPRequestHandler for enhanced functionality
- **Security Headers**: Implements basic web security headers
- **Static File Serving**: Efficient serving of HTML, CSS, and asset files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful shutdown with keyboard interrupt handling

## Data Flow

### Request Flow
1. Client requests website URL
2. Python server receives HTTP request
3. Custom handler processes request and applies security headers
4. Static files (HTML, CSS, assets) are served to client
5. Browser renders the portfolio website

### Navigation Flow
- Single-page application with hash-based navigation
- JavaScript handles smooth scrolling between sections
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu for smaller screens

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography
- **Font Awesome**: Version 6.0 for icons and symbols
- **CDN Delivery**: External resources loaded via CDN for performance

### Backend Dependencies
- **Python Standard Library**: Uses built-in modules (http.server, socketserver, os, sys, pathlib)
- **No External Packages**: Minimal dependency approach using only Python standard library

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **Server Configuration**: Runs on localhost:5000 with 0.0.0.0 binding
- **File Serving**: Serves files from the script's directory location
- **Development Workflow**: Simple start/stop with Ctrl+C interrupt handling

### Production Considerations
- **Static Hosting Ready**: Can be easily deployed to any static hosting service
- **Server Options**: Python server for development; production should use proper web server
- **Asset Optimization**: External CDN dependencies for improved loading times
- **Security**: Basic security headers implemented, suitable for enhancement in production

### Scalability
- **Static Nature**: Highly scalable due to static file architecture
- **CDN Compatible**: Easy integration with Content Delivery Networks
- **Caching Strategy**: Static assets are naturally cacheable for performance

## Technical Decisions

### Why Static Architecture?
- **Simplicity**: Portfolio websites don't require complex backend logic
- **Performance**: Fast loading times with minimal server overhead
